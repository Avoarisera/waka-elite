Recommended Tech Stack for Waka Waka
Based on the project requirements outlined in the PRD and your preference for Quasar and Supabase, the following tech stack is recommended:
1. Frontend
Framework: Quasar Framework (Vue.js)
Reasoning: As specified. Quasar is a high-performance, mobile-first, and responsive Vue.js framework that allows building web, mobile (iOS/Android), and desktop applications from a single codebase. Its extensive set of UI components and built-in features like routing, state management integration, and build optimization make it ideal for developing the "Waka Waka" interface efficiently.
Language: TypeScript
Reasoning: While Quasar supports plain JavaScript, using TypeScript adds static typing, which significantly improves code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity, especially as the project grows. It helps catch errors early in the development process.
State Management: Pinia
Reasoning: Pinia is the official state management library for Vue.js and is highly recommended with Vue 3 (which Quasar v2 uses). It's simple, lightweight, and provides a great developer experience with strong TypeScript support. It's perfect for managing the application's state, such as user data, event lists, project ideas, etc.
Styling: Tailwind CSS (Optional, alongside Quasar's built-in styling)
Reasoning: Quasar provides its own styling utilities and components. However, integrating Tailwind CSS can offer even more flexibility and speed in building custom layouts and components with utility-first classes, aligning well with the desire for an impactful and aesthetically pleasing design. This is an optional addition but can enhance development speed for custom UI elements.
2. Backend
Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS): Supabase
Reasoning: As specified. Supabase provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, storage, and serverless functions. This covers the core backend needs of "Waka Waka," including managing user profiles, events, ideas, stories, recommendations, and potentially handling image/video uploads for profiles and stories. Its real-time capabilities are beneficial for features like event participation updates or new comments/likes on ideas.
Database: PostgreSQL (Managed by Supabase)
Reasoning: Supabase uses PostgreSQL, a powerful, reliable, and feature-rich relational database system. It's well-suited for structuring the various types of data in "Waka Waka" (users, events, ideas, stories, relationships between users, etc.).
Authentication: Supabase Auth
Reasoning: Supabase provides a comprehensive authentication system supporting various methods (email/password, social logins). This simplifies the implementation of user registration and login for "Waka Waka."
Storage: Supabase Storage
Reasoning: Supabase Storage is ideal for handling file uploads, such as profile photos, event visuals, and media for inspiring stories.
Real-time: Supabase Realtime
Reasoning: This feature allows you to listen to database changes in real-time. It can be used to instantly update the UI when new comments are added, event participation counts change, or new mini-challenge responses are posted, contributing to a "living" and dynamic feel.
3. Deployment
Hosting: Vercel or Netlify
Reasoning: Both Vercel and Netlify offer excellent free tiers and seamless integration with Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). They are optimized for hosting modern web applications built with frameworks like Quasar (Vue.js) and provide features like automatic deployments, global CDNs for performance, and custom domain support. They pair very well with Supabase as the backend.
4. Other Considerations
API Interaction: Use Supabase's JavaScript client library to interact with the database, authentication, and storage directly from your Quasar frontend.
Serverless Functions (Optional): For specific backend logic not directly handled by Supabase's core features (e.g., sending notification emails, complex data processing), you could leverage Supabase Functions (based on Deno) or integrate with cloud functions from providers like Netlify Functions or Vercel Functions.
This stack leverages the strengths of Quasar for the frontend and Supabase for the backend, providing a robust, scalable, and efficient foundation for building the "Waka Waka" application with a focus on a great user experience.
